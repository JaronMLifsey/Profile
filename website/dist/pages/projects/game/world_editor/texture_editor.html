		I had two goals for texturing: steep inclines should not look stretched and the number of textures allowed per map should not be restrictive.

	<div class="section">
		<h2 class="section-title">tri-planar texturing</h2>
		<p>
			I struggled with the first goal but eventually found inspiration from
			<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-i-geometry/chapter-1-generating-complex-procedural-terrains-using-gpu">this site</a> to use tri-planar projection texturing.
			This technique samples textures from the the x, y, and z planes separately based on the surface normal and blends the samples near the 45 degree angles to remove sharp transitions.
			There's a bit of overhead due to having to sample each texture three times instead of one, but it's relatively minor and the results were quite good.

		<h2 class="section-title">254 textures maximum</h2>
		<p>
			Goal two was achieved by using a texture array for diffuse textures.
			Two other texture arrays were used, one for their alpha values (4-component 8-bit unsigned normalized) and the other to select which textures would appear at any location (4-component 8-bit unsigned int).
			This allowed for 4 textures at any one point and up to 254 textures in total (255 was reserved to indicate that no diffuse texture should be sampled).
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Deciding the four textures to choose was done by considering the square region formed from the corners of each grouping of four adjacent sampling texels.
			The alpha of all textures used by those four sampling texels were summed and the textures with lowest average alpha removed.
			The four alpha values for the remaining textures were then scaled to equal one.
			This removed the possibility of harsh lines appearing due to adjacent texels disagreeing on which set of textures should be sampled from.
		</p>

		<p>
			The asset manager was very rudimentary.
			It would open a file explorer where all terrain textures were located and allow for selecting which ones would be available for the current terrain.
			Those would then populate a drop-down list.
			The video below shows shows the final results of the texture Editing.

		<h2 class="section-title">Decals</h2>
		<p>
			Terrain decals were also implemented, though I never created any assets for it besides a circle used in the editors.
			As the renderer was deferred, decals were implemented by drawing a box to the screen that would contain the full possible size for the decal.
			The world position of each terrain pixel was calculated from the depth buffer and screen coordinate which was then used to calculate a texture sample position.
