        <p>
            This editor allows for painting grass on the terrain.
            This was achieved by creating a grid where each square would have several instances of grass within it.
			The instanced would be layed out within a smaller sub-grid, but randomly placed within these child squares.
            The order which instances would appear at grater density levels (from "painting") was also random.
			This allowed for consistent results when paining, but prevented a grid-like appearance.
            Grass rendering was optimized by only rendering quadrants in view.
        </p>

            The grass also responds to wind which was implemented as a 2D texture stretched over the map created with multiple sign waves of varying amplitude, frequency, and direction.

            Allowing for a variety of foliage models was intended, but never implemented.
            The editor, as I left it, allows for selecting only one model per map.
