    <H2 class="section-title">Vertex Editing</H2>
    <p>
      Vertex editing supports raising, lowering, flattening, or smoothing as well as undoing and redoing edits.
      All editing types use an outer radius, inner radius, and a 'scale'.
      Editing is performed at 100% of the scale within the inner radius and uses a cubic interpolation to zero at the outer radius.

    <H2 class="section-title">Adjustable Detail</H2>
    <p>
      The terrain was created to increase geometric detail around areas with sharper height gradients.
      This was done by subdividing any quads that had internal angles that were too sharp for how large they were.
      Looking back, this was a premature optimization, but the end result was still pretty neat.

    <H2 class="section-title">Geometry Stitching</H2>
    <p>
      Having subdivided quads without proper stitching for the triangles introduced a problem however.
      Floating point errors would cause some pixels along the seams to not be considered part of either quad and so wouldn't render.
      This was solved by shifting all vertices of subdivided quads neighboring larger quads slightly towards the larger ones creating a bit of overlap.
