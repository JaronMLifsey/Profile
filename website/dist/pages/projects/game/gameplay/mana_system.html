        <p>
            Magic particles were spread throughout the map and would be pulled towards towers and consumed to power their attacks.
            These particles were a limited resource but would be replenished slowly at a rate proportional to how magic deficient the map was.
            This created a mechanic whereby players would have to strategize carefully about tower placement to not starve other towers or overly deplete particular areas.

        <p>
            Towers applied a gravity to the mana particles whenever their mana pool was not full.
            Gravity was implemented as a sparse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree#:~:text=An%20octree%20is%20a%20tree,three%2Ddimensional%20analog%20of%20quadtrees.">octree</a> where nodes further from gravity sources would be subdivided less.
            This allowed for the gravity map to only be updated when a tower turned on or off its gravity and only for a small fraction of the total octants.
        </p>
        <p>
            All particles (more than 16,000 of them) would update their velocity and position every frame based on a gravity sample obtained by traversing the full height of the octree at its location.
            Those moving quickly and near by a gravity field would be updated up to 15 times a frame to keep the simulation accurate at the extremes.
        </p>
        <p>
            This method allowed for a fairly accurate simulation containing many gravity sources and many particles while remaining very computationally cheap.
            The entire game only had a 2-3% CPU utilization running at 100FPS (on a Ryzen 3700x).
