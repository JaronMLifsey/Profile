        <p>
            The planned core gameplay consisted of multiple types of upgradable towers, spells, and a variety of enemies which would come in waves.
            The main resource was to be mana spread throughout the map as particles what would be sucked up by towers and be expended to attack or otherwise perform their function.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only gameplay elements implemented before the project was abandoned was the mana system, a single target lightning tower, and one very basic enemy which was just a animated block, but the core gameplay can still be seen below.

        <p>
			The user interface was far from complete.
			It allowed the selecting of spells and towers either with the mouse or hotkeys.
			The mini-map could be used to drag the view around the map and showed an outline around the part of the math that was visible.
			The mini-map image was generated when he map was saved by rendering the while map from a top down view high above.
			The enemy spawn timeline was placeholder.
