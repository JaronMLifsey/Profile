			A 2D boolean array was used to configure where towers could be placed.
			Each tower would take up 4 squares.
            The editor allowed for simple painting; left click to paint red (unavailable) and right click to clear it (available).
            The "brush" size could be increased and decreased by pressing the up or down arrow keys.
